# Sulfide weathering experiments from Maffre et al., submitted to GRL (2021)

Information about GEOCLIM runs for the sulfide weathering perturbation experiments

## Run outputs

#### Where to find the output

The outputs of the sulfide weathering simulations are stored in "OUTPUT/sulfur\_experiments/".
Only the COMBINE outputs (i.e., ocean and atmosphere "box" variables and integrated fluxes) are available.
The geographic outputs are too heavy be be stored in GitHub.

#### Run nomenclature

Several run outputs are stored in the repertory. All their names follow the same structure:

geoclim_output.runname\_?.nc

Where "runname" is the name of the GEOCLIM run, and "?" is integer number, denoting a subdivision of a single run.


## How to reproduce the runs
