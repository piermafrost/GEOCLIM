The scripts present in this repertory are meant to generate or modify the boundary condition
files "slope" and "lithology fraction".
All these scripts (Fortran and Python ones) contain a short description about how to use them,
at the beginning of the code.

The Fortran source files can be compiled with the Makefile (e.g., `make remove_null_slope`).
To do so, use the same compilation options as for the main GEOCLIM program, that are stored in
"../GEOCLIM_environment" after invoking `build_GEOCLIM`.
e.g., `make remove_null_slope FC=ifort NCPATH=/usr MODE=optim`

The subrepertory "example_tecto_split/" contains the input data for generating paleo slope field
with the non-parametric method based on elevation and geology categories.
!Those example data files are archived (tar.gz file)!

The subrepertory "BC/" contains the Python scripts for generating the "main" boundary condition files
