Each sub-directory in this current directory corresponds to a simulation conducted for Maffre et al. (2024, submitted to GMD).
Each contains the configuration files "IO_CONDITIONS" and "cond_p20.dat" (potentially with some variations).
To set-up a GEOCLIM simulation, copy the 2 files (one "IO_CONDITIONS..." and one "cond_p20./dat") of the given sub-directory and
replace the original "IO_CONDITIONS" and "cond_p20.dat" in main "config/" directory (i.e., the parent directory).
The 3rd configuration files "GCM_input_condition" associated with all given simulations are stored in the current directory, and are
already pointed toward in the corresponding "IO_CONDITIONS..." files.
