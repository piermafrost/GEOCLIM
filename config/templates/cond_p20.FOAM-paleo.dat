  ! SOLVER
  ! ======

  solver = 'rk4'

  ! Time step, starting and ending times
  ts   = 0.02 	!solver timestep (yrs)  !-> 0.01 with O2 and SO4 accelerated
  tsta = 0	!Starting time for iteration (yrs)
  tfi  = 50d3	!Ending time for iteration (yrs)

  ! Acceleration factors for long elemental cycles
  oxy_acc_fact  = 33.	!oxygen acceleration factor (1. is for no acceleration) -- 50. is a good value for equilibrium-reaching
  sulf_acc_fact = 33.	!sulfate acceleration factor (1. is for no acceleration) -- 50. is a good value for equilibrium-reaching

  ! Asynchronous coupling of modules
  ijump_climate        = 5000	!integrate climate-dependent fields and continental weathering every ....*timestep (yrs)
  ijump_DS_integration = 1	!integrate DYNSOIL variables every .... * ijump_climate * timestep (yrs)
  ijump_climparam      = 5000	!read climatic parameters every ....*timesehp (yrs) => ignored if no climatic parameters other than CO2
  ijump_veget          = 100000	!read next vegetation map every ....*timestep (yrs) => ignored if vegetation module not activated

  ! Printing times
  ! --------------
